-- what I assume you know
	 * a little about objects: enough to roll one and use it
	 * a little about sub references ("closures", "anonymous subs"): enough to create one and invoke it

	 -- Here's both of those things in 60 seconds:
	 		* "an object is a reference that knows how to find its actions"
				-- that means: $duck->eat('bread') # $duck knows where 'sub eat' is
				-- when 'sub eat' is found, it automatically gets $duck passed in
				-- that's the tip of the iceberg but really is enough
			* "a sub reference is an unnamed sub"
				-- that means:
					 my $bumper;
					 {
							my $i = 0;
							$bumper = sub { $i++; return $i };
					 }
					 # even though $i looks like it's gone out of scope, $bumper has
					 # access to it
				-- a closure is a sub reference that "closes" over some variables,
					 like $i in the example above.
				-- A sub reference is just a reference, so invoking it is just a
					 standard de-referencing operation:
					 $bumper->(); $bumper->();	# bump it, bump it!

		-- Great, we're all up to speed.
