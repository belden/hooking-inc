-- goals:
	 * introduce the @INC hooks described in 'perldoc -f require'
   * introduce tied @INC
   * gotchas

-- Here's why you might care about this:
	 * sheer play; knowledge collection  # totally legit goals
	 * answer questions about a codebase # my sweet spot, and what I'll focus on
	 * generate sourcecode               # why die during 'use' when you can just fake it
	 * automatic cpan installs           # why fake it when you can install it

-- perldoc -f require: @INC can have hooks put in it:
	 1. subroutine reference:   unshift @INC, \&hook;
	 2. array reference         unshift @INC, [\&hook, @args_for_hook];
	 3. object                  unshift @INC, $object;

-- how they should act:
	 * "I don't know how to handle this thing, move on down the line."
	 	 		return undef;

	 * "Oh, I found that file, here it is!"
	 	 	 open my $fh, '<', $somewhere;
			 return $fh;

	 * "Here, let me make that for you."
	 	 	 return $generator; # this needs to be a subref

-- What they get depends on what you've put in place:
	 1. subroutine reference:
	 	  	my ($reference_to_myself, $file_to_load) = @_;
	 2. array reference:
	      my ($array_reference, $file_to_load) = @_;
	 3. object:
	 		  my ($self, $file_to_load) = @_;

-- Let's see some code. Here's how you can keep track of everything that your program loads.

     1    package INCSnooper;
     2    
     3    sub import {
     4    		unshift @INC, \&tracker;
     5    }
     6    
     7    sub tracker {
     8         my ($me, $file_to_load) = @_;
     9    
    10         warn "want to load: $file_to_load\n";
    11    
    12         return undef;        # send a "keep looking" message
    13    }
    14    
    15    1;

		$ perl -I. -MINCSnooper -e 'use strict; use warnings; use Data::Dumper'
		want to load: strict.pm
		want to load: warnings.pm
		want to load: Data/Dumper.pm
		want to load: Carp.pm
		want to load: Exporter.pm
		want to load: XSLoader.pm
		want to load: bytes.pm
		want to load: overload.pm
		want to load: warnings/register.pm

-- We can make the output a bit more pretty:

     1	package INCSnooper::Pretty;
     2	
     3	sub import {
     4		unshift @INC, \&tracker;
     5	}
     6	
     7	sub tracker {
     8		 my ($me, $file_to_load) = @_;
     9	
    10		 my $padding = '';
    11		 my $lookback = 0;
    12		 while (caller($lookback)) {
    13			 $padding .= "-->" if (caller($lookback++))[7];      # only bump padding if this frame is_require.
    14		 }
    15	
    16		 $padding =~ s{->-}{---}g;                             # I'm lame
    17		 warn "$padding$file_to_load\n";
    18		 return undef;                                     		 # send a "keep looking" message
    19	}
    20	
    21	1;

		$ perl -I. -MINCSnooper::Pretty -e 'use strict; use warnings; use Data::Dumper'
		strict.pm
		warnings.pm
		Data/Dumper.pm
		-->Carp.pm
		----->Exporter.pm
		-->XSLoader.pm
		-->bytes.pm
		-->overload.pm
		----->warnings/register.pm

-- You could iterate on that.

-- I'm not going to show you array references in @INC. They seem like a weird halfway point between a bare
	 coderef and an object. There's one gotcha with sticking an object in INC: it needs to implement a method
	 named INC, but it has to be fully qualified into that package's namespace.

   1	package foo;
   2	
   3	sub INC { print "hello world\n" }
   4	
   5	1;


   $ perl -Mfoo -e 'foo->INC'
   Can't locate object method "INC" via package "foo" at -e line 1.

	 $ perl -Mfoo -e 'main->INC'
	 hello world

-- Here it is done right:

   1	package bar;
   2	
   3	sub bar::INC { print "greetings earthlings\n" }
   4	
   5	1;

   $ perl -Mbar -e 'bar->INC'
	 greetings earthlings

-- This has just been a recitation of 'perldoc -f require' so far. You can choose for yourself whether to stick
	 coderefs,
